    "### 1. What's one real-world scenario where you might try using Bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Scenario 1: College Admissions**<br>\n",
    "For example, if a college wants to make decisions about admissions and select the best students, we can use various factors such as grades, test scores, after-school activities, and recommendation letters that these students have. In this scenario, Bagging can be employed to train multiple admission models, and each of these models may have different preferences and biases. In each case, we will combine all the decisions obtained from different models. With this method, we can ensure that the final decision will be more balanced and have fewer biases.\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Credit Risk Assessment**<br>\n",
    "In the banking and financial industry, when assessing the credit risk of loan applicants, we could use bagging techniques. Each model in the group can evaluate an applicant's creditworthiness independently, considering factors like income, credit history, and employment status. By combining the predictions from multiple models, we can make a more dependable decision on whether to approve a loan. Bagging plays a crucial role in lessening the impact of errors in individual models, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy of credit risk assessments.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What's one real-world scenario where you might try using Random Forests?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Scenario 1: Course Recommendation System**<br>\n",
    "In a college's course recommendation system, Random Forests can be employed with effectiveness. Each decision tree in the Random Forest can grasp different aspects of course selection criteria, including prerequisites, student interests, and course availability. By combining predictions from various trees, the system can offer students more accurate course recommendations. This approach utilizes the diversity in course selection criteria, ensuring recommendations are precise without overly customizing them to individual student preferences.\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Medical Diagnosis**<br> \n",
    "In the field of healthcare, especially in medical diagnosis, Random Forests prove to be a valuable tool. Imagine a situation where we must diagnose a patient's condition using a mix of medical test results, symptoms, and patient history. Random Forests can construct a group of decision trees, each concentrating on different facets of the diagnosis, like symptoms, test results, and medical history. This amalgamation of decision trees leads to a more resilient and precise diagnosis, taking into account varied sources of information and lessening the risk of misclassification.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What's one real-world scenario where you might try using Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Scenario 1: Graduation Prediction**<br>\n",
    "When trying to predict if a student will graduate on time, Boosting proves helpful. In each boosting round, the focus is on enhancing prediction accuracy by giving extra attention to factors that caused prediction errors before, like course failures or academic challenges. By giving more weight to these areas and steadily refining the model, the college can offer more personalized guidance and support to students who might be at risk of not graduating on time.<br>\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Predicting Customers might stop shopping in Online Store:**<br>\n",
    "Boosting techniques prove useful in identifying customers who might cease online shopping. Employing special methods such as AdaBoost or GradientBoosting, Boosting teaches models gradually, allowing them to improve by recognizing and learning from mistakes. With every customer interaction or purchase on the website, valuable information is gained. By assigning greater significance to customers exhibiting specific behaviors, Boosting aids in detecting signs indicating a potential departure. This proactive approach enables the store to take early action, retaining customers and preventing them from leaving.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Some Explanation**\n",
    "Bagging resembles collecting votes from various model groups. Each model learns from a random section of the training data and contributes an equal vote to the final decision. This proves beneficial when aiming to decrease variance and overfitting, akin to seeking diverse opinions from different individuals to enhance decision-making. Boosting, on the other hand, revolves around gradual model improvement. Models are trained sequentially, with each new model dedicated to rectifying errors made by its predecessors. Models making more mistakes receive increased attention. It's akin to having a personal tutor guiding improvement by concentrating on individual weaknesses.<br>\n",
    "source link: https://www.ibm.com/topics/bagging<br>\n",
    "RandomForest stands out as a distinctive ensemble learning technique, blending the concepts of Bagging and randomness. It constructs numerous decision trees, with each tree learning from distinct data sections. Additionally, each part of the tree only utilizes a random set of features. This approach assembles a robust and trustworthy team that leverages diverse models and various facets of the problem to enhance decision-making. Think of it as having a team of experts, each specializing in different areas, and collectively utilizing a limited set of reference sources to make well-informed decisions.<br>\n",

This tells us how good the model is at understanding the patterns in the training data.\n",
    "But, we should be careful. Just because it's doing well on the training data doesn't mean it will do just as well on new, unseen data (like the test set).

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">Bagging, is a technique in machine learning that enhances model performance by training multiple instances of the same algorithm on diverse subsets of the training data, generated through random sampling with replacement. The predictions are then aggregated, typically through averaging for regression or voting for classification. Random Forest, an extension of bagging applied to decision trees, introduces an additional layer of randomness. Each tree in the random forest is constructed using a random subset of features at each split. This extra randomness enhances model diversity, reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance. The RandomForestRegressor() function can handle both random forests and bagging, making it versatile for these ensemble techniques.</span>"

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">The result, 19.46, represents the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted values (pred) and the actual values (y_test). MSE is a standard measure for assessing how well a regression model performs. In simpler terms, it's the average of the squared differences between each predicted and actual value. The process involves squaring the differences for each data point, adding them up, and then dividing by the number of data points. For your regression model, a MSE of 19.46 indicates that, on average, the squared difference between predictions and actual values is around 19.46. Smaller MSE values are preferred, signaling better model accuracy by indicating smaller deviations between predicted and actual values. Hence, aiming for a lower MSE is desirable for improved predictive performance in this context. Here we can see that the test dataset MSE related to Bagged regression tree is a lot lower than our single tree (that it was 35.4).</span>"

    "### What's one real-world scenario where you might try using Bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Scenario 1: College Admissions**<br>\n",
    "For example, if a college wants to make decisions about admissions and select the best students, we can use various factors such as grades, test scores, after-school activities, and recommendation letters that these students have. In this scenario, Bagging can be employed to train multiple admission models, and each of these models may have different preferences and biases. In each case, we will combine all the decisions obtained from different models. With this method, we can ensure that the final decision will be more balanced and have fewer biases.\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Credit Risk Assessment**<br>\n",
    "In the banking and financial industry, when assessing the credit risk of loan applicants, we could use bagging techniques. Each model in the group can evaluate an applicant's creditworthiness independently, considering factors like income, credit history, and employment status. By combining the predictions from multiple models, we can make a more dependable decision on whether to approve a loan. Bagging plays a crucial role in lessening the impact of errors in individual models, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy of credit risk assessments.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's one real-world scenario where you might try using Random Forests?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Scenario 1: Course Recommendation System**<br>\n",
    "In a college's course recommendation system, Random Forests can be employed with effectiveness. Each decision tree in the Random Forest can grasp different aspects of course selection criteria, including prerequisites, student interests, and course availability. By combining predictions from various trees, the system can offer students more accurate course recommendations. This approach utilizes the diversity in course selection criteria, ensuring recommendations are precise without overly customizing them to individual student preferences.\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Medical Diagnosis**<br> \n",
    "In the field of healthcare, especially in medical diagnosis, Random Forests prove to be a valuable tool. Imagine a situation where we must diagnose a patient's condition using a mix of medical test results, symptoms, and patient history. Random Forests can construct a group of decision trees, each concentrating on different facets of the diagnosis, like symptoms, test results, and medical history. This amalgamation of decision trees leads to a more resilient and precise diagnosis, taking into account varied sources of information and lessening the risk of misclassification.</span>\n",

    "### What's one real-world scenario where you might try using Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Scenario 1: Graduation Prediction**<br>\n",
    "When trying to predict if a student will graduate on time, Boosting proves helpful. In each boosting round, the focus is on enhancing prediction accuracy by giving extra attention to factors that caused prediction errors before, like course failures or academic challenges. By giving more weight to these areas and steadily refining the model, the college can offer more personalized guidance and support to students who might be at risk of not graduating on time.<br>\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Predicting Customers might stop shopping in Online Store:**<br>\n",
    "Boosting techniques prove useful in identifying customers who might cease online shopping. Employing special methods such as AdaBoost or GradientBoosting, Boosting teaches models gradually, allowing them to improve by recognizing and learning from mistakes. With every customer interaction or purchase on the website, valuable information is gained. By assigning greater significance to customers exhibiting specific behaviors, Boosting aids in detecting signs indicating a potential departure. This proactive approach enables the store to take early action, retaining customers and preventing them from leaving.</span>\n",

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Some Explanation**\n",
    "Bagging resembles collecting votes from various model groups. Each model learns from a random section of the training data and contributes an equal vote to the final decision. This proves beneficial when aiming to decrease variance and overfitting, akin to seeking diverse opinions from different individuals to enhance decision-making. Boosting, on the other hand, revolves around gradual model improvement. Models are trained sequentially, with each new model dedicated to rectifying errors made by its predecessors. Models making more mistakes receive increased attention. It's akin to having a personal tutor guiding improvement by concentrating on individual weaknesses.<br>\n",

    "RandomForest stands out as a distinctive ensemble learning technique, blending the concepts of Bagging and randomness. It constructs numerous decision trees, with each tree learning from distinct data sections. Additionally, each part of the tree only utilizes a random set of features. This approach assembles a robust and trustworthy team that leverages diverse models and various facets of the problem to enhance decision-making. Think of it as having a team of experts, each specializing in different areas, and collectively utilizing a limited set of reference sources to make well-informed decisions.<br>\n",
